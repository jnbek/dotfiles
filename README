These are my dotfiles. Most are cobbled together from stuff I've found over the years on Google and various websites. I actively use these files and can not live without them. So here they are for the world to see. The following utilities are represented:

Zsh 4.4         http://www.zsh.org/  
Vim 7.2         http://vim.sf.net/
Tmux 1.1        http://tmux.sourceforge.net/

Screen 4.0.3    http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
Bash 3.X        http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
